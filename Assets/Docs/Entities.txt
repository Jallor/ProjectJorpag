Entities are objects that are spawn in the scene
They will be mostly character like the player, but it can also something else (tower, trap, ...)

Entity ID
Each entity have a unique ID. It's an unique unsigned int between 0 and int.maxValue (~2milliard)
ID between 0 and 10.000 can't be randomly assigned, they are reserved for explicite IDs.
Those explicite IDs are set by the meta data of the map, for example when you place a character in a specific position
ID 0 is only for the player
ID -1 is an error or for an entity that is not initialized. It must not appear during game

Having EntityID will be used by VarSelector to find an entity, wherever it is
Having EntityID for specified in MapMetaData will be used to link entities with the rest of the logic of the map
e.g. trigger an effect only if a specific character enter a zone
