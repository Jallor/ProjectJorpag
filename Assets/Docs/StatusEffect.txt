 == Adding Status of same type ==
The first issue is that adding a status may result in two situation :
	- They don't stack, so each time a status is applied, it create a new instance of it
	- They stack on them, meaning that the new one is not applied but it increse or reset values of the current one. 
It will depend the status effect. However, the second situation will trigger other situation.
E.g. applying a fire DoT or a poison DoT result in the same gameplay effect but different intention.

TODO : confirm that the tryAdd may be canceled if the target is imune to this status
